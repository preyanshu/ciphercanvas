# Test Coverage Analysis

## ✅ Currently Tested

### Setup & Initialization
- [x] Initialize computation definitions (before hook)
- [x] Initialize proposal system
- [x] System initialization callback

### Core Functionality  
- [x] Submit proposals (3 proposals)
- [x] Cast encrypted votes (3 votes for different proposals)
- [x] Reveal winning proposal
- [x] Event emission (proposalSubmittedEvent, voteEvent, winningProposalEvent)

## ❌ Missing Test Coverage

### 1. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [ ] Submit more than 10 proposals (should fail with MaxProposalsReached)
- [ ] Vote for non-existent proposal ID (should fail with InvalidProposalId)
- [ ] Non-authority trying to reveal results (should fail with InvalidAuthority)
- [ ] Submit proposal with title > 50 characters (should fail)
- [ ] Submit proposal with description > 200 characters (should fail)
- [ ] Vote for proposal ID > 9 (should fail with InvalidProposalId)

### 2. Multiple Voters Scenario
- [ ] Multiple different users submitting proposals
- [ ] Multiple different users voting for same proposal
- [ ] Multiple different users voting for different proposals
- [ ] Verify winning proposal with distributed votes

### 3. Account State Validation
- [ ] Read and verify proposal account data (title, description, submitter)
- [ ] Read and verify system account state (next_proposal_id increments)
- [ ] Verify PDA derivation for proposals
- [ ] Verify encrypted vote state updates

### 4. Tie Scenarios
- [ ] Two proposals with equal votes (test winner selection logic)
- [ ] All proposals with zero votes
- [ ] Single proposal with votes

### 5. System State
- [ ] Attempt to reinitialize system (should fail - account already exists)
- [ ] Verify system can only be initialized once per PDA

### 6. Computation Finalization
- [ ] Test computation timeout scenarios
- [ ] Verify computation finalization before reading results

## Recommendations

1. **Add Error Handling Tests** - Create a new test suite for expected failures
2. **Add Multi-User Tests** - Create multiple keypairs and test concurrent voting
3. **Add State Verification Tests** - Read account data and verify correctness
4. **Add Stress Tests** - Test with maximum limits (10 proposals, many voters)

## Test Quality Improvements

1. Use proper assertions beyond `.to.be.a('string')`
2. Verify actual values in events match expected
3. Test error messages match custom error codes
4. Add test comments explaining what each test validates
